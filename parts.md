## Seat
Start with the important stuff, sitting down.

### Pan
Seems like there were a couple of options for original seats:
- Seat - 9 holes (As Original Style) - `S.61598`
- Seat - Alternative to S.61598 - `S.71478`

This seems to be a good find as it list oem part numbers, which should help.

Looks like repoduction seats are widely available

### Cushions
Looks like a couple of suitable cushions, all tied on underneath.

### Pan Spring

### Fixings
cradock doc suggests fitting is `Bolt - (5/8"x6" UNF)`, `Washer - Spring (M16)` and `Nut (5/8” UNF)`. These should be pretty standard and easy to pick up.
Most images show 4 smaller holes around the main fixing, presumably to stop it spinning, I've found referneces to `Ferguson TE Bolt - Seat Pan to Bracket - 1280079` for about £3 each, £15 each on ebay(!) and suggestions these are simply standard `Carriage Bolts & Nuts M8 x 25mm` which are 10 for £7.
However the seat bracket doesn't look like it has quite matching holes so may need investigation.
