- Online many people recommend 15w40 for engine and transmission, others recomment SUTO (super universal tractor oil), others disagree and point out that think oil will lead to leaks (Things weren't machined to modern spec's back in the day).
- Most people seem to agree that modern oils contain detegents and addatives, and _detergents_ will cause issues in your engine (unless it has been recently rebuilt) as it will shift loads of crud and gum up the works.

> Gear oil differs from engine oil. While many motorists may assume SAE 90 gear oil is thicker than SAE 40 or 50 engine oil, their viscosities are the same <chart>
